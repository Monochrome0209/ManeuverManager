# ManeuverManager

This repository is a project to manage the maneuvers of the TRPG "永い後日談のネクロニカ".  
The basic function is to manage the maneuvers of each player character.  
Maneuvers can be selected officially or unofficially, so if you wish to add an unofficial maneuver, please ask the Game Master of the session you are participating in for approval.
